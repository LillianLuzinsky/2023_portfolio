    <h2>Header Background Fade on Scroll</h2>
    <p>
      13 years ago, I left my demanding job and ventured into freelance design in order to regain my creative energy and do more rewarding work with the community. I look back at the past decade and feel proud to have been able to achieve exactly what I set out to do, but now it's time for my new journey.
      <br>
      I recently undertook the challenge of learning to code and successfully completed the Software Engineering immersive course at General Assembly. Today, I consider myself a versatile designer and front end developer. I have an interest in learning how to build products that are user focused and I would like to keep on learning to be a better problem solver.
      <br>
      Since July 2020 I have been working as a Creative Technologist for a startup called 10xEvolve, where I have been collaborating in designing their website and products that will soon benefit students, educators and parents, and I am also an active member and UX/UI mentor at Code.Sydney. My proudest achievement in 2020 is that I have created an explainer video in Adobe After Effects. I absolutely fell in love with motion graphics and I will continue to refine this new skill to the fullest as I believe it can compliment my UI design skills. I thrive working in a team where I can contribute creatively everyday in my new career.
